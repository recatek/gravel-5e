## Core Rulebooks

This campaign generally draws from content from the following rulebooks. If two sources present rules for the same character creation option, the rules from the most recently published source will be used. For now, the 202X (One D&D) version of the Player's Handbook will not be used in this campaign.

- Player's Handbook 2014 (PHB)
- Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse (MotM)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGtE)
- Eberron: Rising from the Last War (ERftLW)

## Guidelines

This campaign follows some general high-level rules and decisions. These are written for players familiar with 5e. If you are not sure what these things mean, be sure to ask the DM.

- All characters are created using the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 distributed as you wish.

- Racial ability score bonuses may be swapped to other ability scores by Tasha's rules (see TCoE pg. 7).

- After level 1, character hit points are always advanced by the die average (half the class hit die size, rounded up).

- All characters gain an additional feat at character creation. Variant human and custom lineage may select two total. 

## Races

The following races are pre-approved and free to pick without consulting the DM:

- Dragonborn (PHB)
- Dwarf (PHB)
- Genasi (MotM)
- Goblin (MotM)

The following races are generally approved but require a discussion with the DM for backstory integration:

- Aasimar (MotM)
- Changeling (MotM)
- Custom Lineage (TCoE)
- Eladrin (MotM)

- Aarakocra (MotM)
- Centaur (MotM)
- Kenku (MotM)
- Minotaur (MotM)
- Satyr (MotM)
- Yuan-ti (MotM)

Some races not listed here are open for discussion. However, races from other campaign settings (e.g. Strixhaven, Theros, Dragonlance) are explicitly banned unless listed above.

## Skills

This campaign introduces the following extra skill:

### Society (Wis)

The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Society) check to determine an individual's social status, gauge the relative safety of a neighborhood, glean information about organizations and territories, identify local mannerisms and colloquialisms, or learn the customs of a subculture. Where the Insight skill focuses on assessing an individual's intentions from body language and mannerisms, the Society skill determines your ability to understand norms and use them to your advantage.

The Society skill is added as a selectable option for the Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Sorcerer, and Warlock classes.

## Backgrounds

Players are strongly encouraged to customize their character backgrounds. (TODO: More info here.)

## Feats

Feats are generally allowed from any of the source rulebooks, but double check with the DM before picking a feat. Feats from Unearthed Arcana and other rulebooks are generally not allowed, but it can't hurt to ask.
