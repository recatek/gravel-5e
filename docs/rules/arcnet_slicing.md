## Arcnet and Slicing

(TODO)

### Slice Decks

Slice Decks are used to gain access to arcnet information and control networks. Security systems, communication relays, some complex locks, automatons and drones, and other devices with arcnet connections are susceptible to these tools. Slicers usually customize their own personal decks, customizing them for ease of use and individual style. 

Proficiency with slice decks lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to infiltrate arcnet devices and networks. Some networks or devices may be too sophisticated or secure to attempt to infiltrate without slice deck proficiency, or may forbid certain actions once infiltrated.
