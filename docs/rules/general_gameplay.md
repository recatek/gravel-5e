*"Dancies we's, in hands at threes.  
Dancies we's, all-rounds and frees.  
Them shiner come, them shiner burn,  
Them shiner takesies all from me's."*

## Top-level Rules

This campaign is generally run as RAW (rules-as-written) as possible, with some supplements to clarify vague language in some areas. The following adjustments are made to general gameplay:

- After taking a long rest, the next two short rests take only ten minutes each. Subsequent short rests take a full hour.

- Potions may be consumed as a bonus action. Administering a potion to another creature still requires an action.

- Death saving throws are secret, private rolls between the character's player and the DM.

- Intimidation can optionally be rolled as a Strength (Intimidation) check in place of Charisma.

- Combat does ***not*** use the Flanking optional rule.

- Cats have Darkvision.

## Natural 20 and Natural 1

In the rules as written (at least in PHB 2014), natural 20 and natural 1 rolls have very little special status beyond critical hits. This campaign will not treat natural 1 or natural 20 as "critical success" or "critical failure" on ability checks or saving throws -- they are success or failure rolls like any other. In combat, rolling a natural 1 on an attack has no ill effect other than the fact that you most likely missed. Try harder next time.
