## Core Rulebooks

This campaign generally draws from content from the following rulebooks. These are presented in priority order, so re-releases of races or spells from books higher in this list override content from books later in it.

- Player's Handbook 2014 (PHB)
- Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG)
- Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse (MotM)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGtE)
- Eberron: Rising from the Last War (ERftLW)

## Character Creation

This campaign follows some general high-level rules and decisions. These are written for players familiar with 5e. If you are not sure what these things mean, be sure to ask the DM.


- All characters are created using the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 distributed as you wish.

- All characters gain an additional feat at character creation. Variant human and custom lineage may select two total.

- Racial ability score bonuses may be moved, but not split. No two racial bonuses may be applied to the same ability score.

- After level 1, character hit points are always advanced by the die average (half the class hit die size, rounded up).


### Race Options

The following races are pre-approved and free to pick without consulting the DM:

- Dragonborn (PHB)
- Dwarf (PHB)

The following races are generally approved but require a discussion with the DM for backstory integration:

- Custom Lineage
- Elf (PHB)
- Aasimar (MotM)
- Warforged (ERftLW)
- Changeling (MotM)

The following races are unlikely to be approved as player races, but ask anyway:

- Aarakocra (MotM)
- Kenku (MotM)
- Centaur (MotM)
- Satyr (MotM)
- Minotaur (MotM)
- Yuan-ti (MotM)

Some races not listed here are open for discussion. However, races from other campaign settings (e.g. Strixhaven, Theros, Dragonlance) are explicitly banned unless listed above.

### Feats

Feats are generally allowed from any of the rulebooks listed above, but double check with the DM before picking a feat. Feats from Unearthed Arcana and other rulebooks are generally not allowed, but it can't hurt to ask.

### Classes

Most classes and subclasses from the rulebooks listed above are permitted in the campaign, including Artificer. There are some exceptions for certain subclasses. Classes from other campaign campaign books are not allowed. Some classes have tweaks and adjustments below:

**Tasha's Optional Rules.** Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers some optional rules for most classes. These are generally open for discussion. The optional rules for the Ranger in particular are recommended. 

**Warlock: The Hexblade.** The "Hex Warrior" feature of the Hexblade is moved, verbatim, to the Warlock's Pact of the Blade feature instead.
